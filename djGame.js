// AirMix: a DJ set as a rhythm game, played with your fingertips on the camera view.
//
// Each target is a shape of four dots: your left thumb and index fingertip (blue) and
// your right thumb and index fingertip (green). Shapes fly in about 2 seconds before
// their beat, shrinking onto their place; have your fingertips on the dots as they land.
// Those four fingertips are the DJ controls, so the chart is choreography:
//   - the right thumb–index gap is the filter: wide = open, narrowing through a build-up
//     closes it, and it snaps open on the drop;
//   - the distance between your hands is the volume: wider on drops, closer in quiet parts;
//   - the left gap is the speed, which stays at 1.00× while you play (it's held);
//   - where the shape sits moves with the music (sways, bobs, circles, steps), one shape
//     every beat or two, each joined to the next so you see where you're going.
// Hitting the shapes is how a good DJ would move right then; your hands really set the
// filter and volume, so missing them sounds like it.
//
// You pick the set before you play (queue.playSet); the mixes are part of the chart:
//   - Blend (tempos close): your right thumb and index slide the new song in along a
//     track, then your left ones slide the old song out. Not following? The AI does it.
//   - Cut (tempos far apart): one shape on the downbeat; the new song slams in and the
//     old one is thrown into an echo.
//
// Shapes hit within ~160 ms of the beat are Perfect, within ~320 ms Good: both hands in
// place, and the right pinch about as open as the shape asks (that's the filter). Hits
// clap on their beat. Slides have a tick on every beat: each one your fingers are on
// clicks and keeps the combo going. How well you play is the crowd's hype. With nobody in frame, nothing
// counts as a miss. The last song fades out at its end and onSetEnd gets your results.
